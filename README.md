# aif2mp3
a shell script to convert aif file to mp3 files using ffmpeg
Created this because my ears can't tell the different between lossless and mp3s. And I wanted to save drive space because the aif files I had were huge.

1. install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) first 
2. download the aif2mp3.sh file and put it in your preferred location such as your home directory or somewhere in your path
3. `chmod +x aif2mp3.sh`
4. cd to a directory containing aif files
5. call aif2mp3: i.e. ~/aif2mp3.sh
